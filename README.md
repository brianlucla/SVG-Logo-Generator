# SVG-Logo-Generator
This project takes in user input to create a svg file that displays a logo of the user's choice

## Description

This project helps users build a simple Logo using SVG. We built this project in order to make it easier for people to create simple logos. This project solves the problem of manually creating logos. From this project, I learned how to use node, npm packages such as inquirer, and jest.

## Installation

To install this program, you will need to run "npm init -y", followed by "npm i inquirer@8.2.4". Then, the user will be able to initiate the program with "node index.js".

## Usage

To use this program, simply answer the prompts that come up in the terminal, and the SVG Logo will be generated in a file called "logo.svg".
